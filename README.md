**Astinus** is an open-source **SBOM enricher** for Docker and OCI container images. It does not generate SBOMs from scratch — instead, it takes the output of existing tools (Syft, Trivy, cdxgen, Microsoft sbom-tool, …) and **fills the gaps they leave behind**.

## Why Astinus?
 
The current generation of SBOM tools is great at one thing — extracting components from package managers (`dpkg`, `apk`, `pip`, `npm`, `gem`, ...). Run Syft on `nginx:latest` and you get a solid inventory of what `apt` and friends know about.
 
But containers don't only contain package-managed software. They also contain:
 
- **Vendored binaries** copied in via `COPY` or `ADD`
- **Statically-linked Go and Rust binaries** with embedded module info
- **JARs, WARs, and other archives** dropped into application directories
- **Scripts and tools** pulled from `curl | sh` or GitHub releases
- **Files inherited from the base image** that get attributed to your team's supply chain even though they're not your responsibility
These are the things your SBOM tool **silently skips**. Vulnerabilities in them won't show up in your scanner. Compliance reports based on these SBOMs are incomplete by design.
 
Astinus reads what your scanners wrote, and writes what they missed.
 
## What Astinus Adds
 
| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Untracked components** | Finds and identifies binaries, archives, and embedded artifacts that aren't tracked by any package manager. Uses fingerprinting (Go `buildinfo`, JAR `MANIFEST.MF`, hash lookups in ClearlyDefined and Software Heritage) to identify what they are. |
| **Layer attribution** | For every component, records which image layer introduced it and which Dockerfile instruction (`RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`) added it. |
| **Base image diff** | Splits components into `base` / `application` / `unknown` so you see exactly what your team added on top of upstream. Auto-detects the base image from OCI labels when possible. |
| **CPE enrichment** | Generates reliable [CPE 2.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) identifiers for components that have a PURL but no CPE — fixing one of the most common reasons NVD-based vulnerability matching produces false negatives. |
| **Format-agnostic** | Reads and writes CycloneDX (1.6) and SPDX (2.3+). Round-trip safe for CycloneDX. |
 
## What Astinus is NOT
 
- **Not a replacement for Syft / Trivy / cdxgen.** It runs *after* them, on their output.
- **Not a vulnerability scanner.** Pair it with Grype, OSV-Scanner, or your existing tooling.
- **Not a SBOM management platform.** Use it with [Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/), [GUAC](https://guac.sh/), or whatever you already have.
## Quickstart (planned)
 
> The commands below describe the intended UX. They will work as soon as the MVP ships. Until then they are spec, not docs.
 
Basic enrichment:
 
```bash
syft myapp:v1 -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.cdx.json
 
astinus enrich \
  --sbom sbom.cdx.json \
  --image myapp:v1 \
  --output enriched.cdx.json
```
 
Pipe-friendly for CI:
 
```bash
syft $IMAGE -o cyclonedx-json | astinus enrich --image $IMAGE -o enriched.cdx.json
```
 
Corporate registry (Artifactory) with auto-detected base image:
 
```bash
astinus enrich \
  --sbom syft.cdx.json \
  --image artifactory.corp.com/team/myapp:v1.2.3 \
  --base auto \
  --output enriched.cdx.json
```
 
Air-gapped environment with offline lookups:
 
```bash
astinus enrich \
  --sbom syft.cdx.json \
  --image-archive ./myapp.tar \
  --no-network \
  --offline-db /opt/astinus/db \
  --output enriched.cdx.json
```

```
 
The pipeline is built around small, composable enrichers. Each enricher reads from and writes to a canonical internal SBOM model — this means new enrichers (e.g., compliance validators for region-specific regulations) can be added without touching the core.
 
## Built for CI/CD
 
Astinus is designed first and foremost as a command-line tool that fits into existing pipelines:
 
- **Single static binary** (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), no runtime dependencies
- **Stdin / stdout pipe-friendly** for streamed pipelines
- **Semantic exit codes** for granular CI failure handling
- **Structured JSON logs** auto-detected in CI environments
- **Stable, deterministic output** for diffing across runs
- **First-class corporate registry support** — JFrog Artifactory, Harbor, Nexus, ECR, GCR, ACR, GHCR
- **mTLS, custom CA bundles, and HTTP proxy** support out of the box
- **Air-gapped mode** with bundled offline databases
Reproducible builds, SLSA Level 3 provenance, and Cosign-signed releases are part of the v1.0 plan.

## Roadmap

The project is broken into 16 implementation stages. Current state:

- ✅ Specification finalized
- ✅ **Stage 0**: Project bootstrap — CLI skeleton, build/lint/CI infrastructure, `astinus version`
- ✅ **Stage 1**: Canonical SBOM model + CycloneDX 1.6 read/write with round-trip preservation of Astinus-added fields
- ✅ **Stage 2**: Image source foundation — registry + tar archive sources, env/docker-config credential chain, custom-CA / proxy / retry transport
- ✅ **Stage 3**: Enrichment pipeline + Layer Attribution enricher + working `astinus enrich` end-to-end command
- ✅ **Stage 4**: Untracked components detection — classify vendored binaries / archives / scripts, extract Go `buildinfo` and JAR `MANIFEST.MF`, pluggable hash → component matcher chain
- ✅ **Stage 5**: Base image diff — auto-detects base from OCI labels, splits components into `base` / `app` / `unknown` via fast layer-prefix comparison with path-fallback for rebased images
- ✅ **Stage 6**: CPE enrichment — bundled hand-curated PURL → CPE mapping with per-PURL-type heuristic fallback; validates existing CPEs; resolver chain ready for offline-DB and online matchers
- ✅ **Stage 7**: SPDX 2.3 read/write — Astinus-typed fields round-trip via SPDX annotations; cross-format CDX↔SPDX with documented lossy areas; `--output-format spdx-json|spdx-tag-value`
- ✅ **Stage 8**: Daemon + OCI layout image sources — `oci://`, `docker-daemon://`, `podman-daemon://` schemes wired (Podman uses Docker Engine API + auto socket fallback); image-source factory now covers every reference shape
- ✅ **Stage 9**: Advanced auth — full native Artifactory provider (Token / API key / OIDC modes, host-scoped) plus informative ECR / GCR / ACR stubs that point operators at the working `<vendor> CLI \| docker login` workflow
- ✅ **Stage 10**: mTLS + per-registry config — YAML config (`registries[]` with per-host auth/TLS/proxy), `transport.PerRegistry` host-dispatching `RoundTripper`, `--config <path>` wired end-to-end
- ✅ **Stage 11**: Output formats — SARIF 2.1.0 (GitHub Code Scanning ready) + human summary; CLI now offers `--output-format same|cyclonedx-json|cyclonedx-xml|spdx-json|spdx-tag-value|sarif|summary`
- ⬜ Stages 12–15 (next): air-gapped mode, fingerprint matchers, policy framework, production polish

The full specification with stage details and acceptance criteria is currently maintained as a private working document.
 
## Extensibility
 
Astinus is designed to be extended without forking. The following extension points are first-class:
 
| Type | Interface | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| **Enricher** | `enrich.Enricher` | New sources of SBOM enrichment (e.g., internal license database) |
| **Validator** | `policy.Validator` | Compliance checks (EU CRA, FedRAMP, internal policies) |
| **Image Source** | `image.source.ImageSource` | Custom image storage backends |
| **Auth Provider** | `image.auth.CredentialProvider` | Corporate authentication systems |
| **Output Renderer** | `output.Renderer` | Internal report formats |
| **Fingerprint Matcher** | `fingerprint.matcher.Matcher` | Internal binary catalogs |
 
Custom builds are assembled by importing additional packages — no plugin system, no runtime overhead, no ABI compatibility headaches.

## The Name
 
In the [Dragonlance](https://dragonlance.fandom.com/wiki/Astinus_of_Palanthas) setting, **Astinus of Palanthas** is the immortal Master Historian of Krynn. From the Great Library of Palanthas, he and his Order of Aesthetics continuously record every event in the world — meticulously, completely, without interpretation. The Chronicles of Krynn are never finished; they are always being added to.
 
The metaphor is direct. Your SBOM is a chronicle of what's inside your container. Existing tools draft it; Astinus continuously fills in what was missed.
 
## Contributing
 
The project is in early development. The most useful contributions right now are:
 
- **Issues**: Edge cases you'd want covered, gaps in the spec, ideas for enrichers
- **Real-world SBOMs and images** that demonstrate the gaps Astinus should close
- **Naming things**: if you spot a clearer term in the spec, suggest it
A formal contribution guide will land with v0.1.
