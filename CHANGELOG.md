# Changelog

All notable post-stage fixes that change observable behaviour. Stage
deliverables themselves are tracked in the implementation log; this
file is for cross-stage fixes that an operator might bisect against.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Auto-detection now correctly resolves locally-built images via the
  Docker / Podman daemon before attempting a registry pull. Previously
  failed with `401 UNAUTHORIZED` when the image existed only in the
  local daemon. Probe is gated by a 2-second timeout and a cheap
  socket-existence check, so the new behaviour adds at most a few
  microseconds when no daemon is running. (ADR-0017)
- Format detection now survives truncation of the 64 KiB peek window:
  large minified CycloneDX SBOMs (Syft 1.34+, ~MiB-scale single-line
  JSON) are classified correctly instead of returning
  `unrecognised format`. (ADR-0016)
